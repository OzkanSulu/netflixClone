# netflixClone
a netflix clone -onlyFrontEnd-
A front-end only Netflix clone built with the latest web technologies. This project was created to showcase the use of APIs for fetching data and the power of Tailwind CSS for styling.

The project uses APIs to retrieve movie and TV show data, allowing users to browse and discover new content. The user interface is designed using Tailwind CSS, making it fast and responsive, while providing a modern and visually appealing look.

Although this project is not a full-fledged, detailed Netflix clone, it provides a solid foundation for those interested in exploring further and adding more features. With its clean and intuitive design, it is a great starting point for anyone looking to dive into front-end web development.

This project is a great learning opportunity for those who want to gain practical experience in using APIs, working with Tailwind CSS, and building modern and dynamic web applications.
